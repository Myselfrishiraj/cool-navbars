                <h2>Jellyfish</h2>
                <h3>Typically, medusozoan cnidarians have a pelagic, predatory jellyfish stage in their life cycle; staurozoans are the exceptions.</h3>

                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>Jellyfish are not a clade, as they include most of the Medusozoa, barring some of the Hydrozoa. The medusozoan groups included by authorities are indicated on the following phylogenetic tree by the presence of citations. Names of included jellyfish, in English where possible, are shown in boldface; the presence of a named and cited example indicates that at least that species within its group has been called a jellyfish.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" id="jellyfish-species" data-target="#jellyfish-species">
                <h4>Species</h4>
                <p>There are over 200 species of Scyphozoa, about 50 species of Staurozoa, about 20 species of Cubozoa, and the Hydrozoa includes about 1000â€“1500 species that produce medusae, but many more species that do not.</p>

            <div class="box" id="jellyfish-more-data" data-target="#jellyfish-more-data">
                <h4>More Data</h4>
                <p>Since jellyfish have no hard parts, fossils are rare. The oldest conulariid scyphozoans appeared between 635 and 577 mya in the Neoproterozoic of the Lantian Formation in China; others are found in the youngest Ediacaran rocks of the Tamengo Formation of Brazil, c. 505 mya, through to the Triassic. Cubozoans and hydrozoans appeared in the Cambrian of the Marjum Formation in Utah, USA, c. 540 mya.</p>
