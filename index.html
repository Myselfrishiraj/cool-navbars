                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>Jellyfish are not a clade, as they include most of the Medusozoa, barring some of the Hydrozoa. The medusozoan groups included by authorities are indicated on the following phylogenetic tree by the presence of citations. Names of included jellyfish, in English where possible, are shown in boldface; the presence of a named and cited example indicates that at least that species within its group has been called a jellyfish.</p>

            <div class="box" id="jellyfish-species" data-target="#jellyfish-species">
                <h4>Species</h4>
                <p>There are over 200 species of Scyphozoa, about 50 species of Staurozoa, about 20 species of Cubozoa, and the Hydrozoa includes about 1000â€“1500 species that produce medusae, but many more species that do not.</p>

                <h4>More Data</h4>
                <p>Since jellyfish have no hard parts, fossils are rare. The oldest conulariid scyphozoans appeared between 635 and 577 mya in the Neoproterozoic of the Lantian Formation in China; others are found in the youngest Ediacaran rocks of the Tamengo Formation of Brazil, c. 505 mya, through to the Triassic. Cubozoans and hydrozoans appeared in the Cambrian of the Marjum Formation in Utah, USA, c. 540 mya.</p>

                <p>
                    Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air.
                    Neon is the second lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: <sup>20</sup>Ne (90.48%), <sup>21</sup>Ne (0.27%) and <sup>22</sup>Ne (9.25%).

                <h4>Applications</h4>
                <p>
                    Neon gas is used in gas discharge lamps. When electricity goes through the neon, it lights up red. Due to this quality, it is used in signs. Similar signs use other gases to make other colors, but they are also often called "neon signs".

                    The word "neon" comes from the Greek word meaning "new". It was discovered by William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers in 1898.
                    Neon does not react with other elements, so it is found by itself. There is not much neon in the air, and it is clear, so we do not see it.

                <p>
                     Skateboarding is as well as a recreational activity, an art form, a entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation.
                     Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years

                <h4>Trick Skating</h4>
                <p>
                    With the evolution of skateparks and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional freestyle manoeuvres like riding on only two wheels ("wheelie" or "manual"), spinning only on the back wheels (a "pivot"), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, also known as a "hippie jump", long jumping from one board to another.

                <p>
                    A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
